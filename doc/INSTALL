libTheSky INSTALL



DEPENDENCIES:

The default installer uses CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is
open-source software, is included in many GNU/Linux distributions, and can be 
downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.  Alternatively, you can create your own
Makefile or compile and link the code manually.

libTheSky needs the Fortran library libSUFR in order to compile and run.  libSUFR is
free and open software, and available under the GPL v.3 from 
http://libsufr.sf.net/.



UNPACKING:

After downloading from libthesky.sf.net, you can unpack the tarball and cd into its 
directory by doing e.g.:

  $ tar xfz libthesky-0.0.1.tar.gz
  $ cd libthesky-0.0.1/

(replace you 0.0.1 with the correct version number).



CONFIGURING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

To configure, compile and install the code and data files (in the default system
directories /usr/local/...), from the main package directory (the one that contains 
the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

The second step above configures the code and should find your Fortran compiler and
libSUFR.  The third step compiles and links the code, and the last step installs it 
on your system - for which you need root priveliges, hence the 'sudo' command.


To install the package in a specific system directory, do e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/libTheSky/ ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the package in your own user directory, you won't need root priveliges,
can omit the 'sudo' command and combine the last two commands, e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/libTheSky/ ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. 
FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the install step
 
 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

The compiled libraries, modules and data files can then be found in the usr/ subdirectory
of the package dir.


By default, library and module files will be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libTheSky.*
/usr/local/include/libTheSky/*.mod


If you want to use the libraries with multiple Fortran compilers, you will want to 
keep the different versions of the library separated.  In this case, use (in addition 
to any other options):
 $ cmake -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on ..

The library files will then be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libTheSky_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*
/usr/local/include/libTheSky/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod

If one of your Fortran compilers is your default, you can use both the default
installation method and the compiler-specific method to install the library.



DATA FILES:

The data files are in the data/ subdirectory of the package and will be installed in
/usr/local/shared/libTheSky/ by default.  All data files needed to run the code are 
provided in the package, except one:  asteroids.dat is not included, since it bloats 
the package by a factor of ~8 and it is readily available online.  To include it, 
download the file http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz, unzip it, rename it 
to asteroids.dat, and copy it to the data/ subdirectory before running make (install), 
or to e.g. /usr/local/shared/libTheSky/ after installing the package.

The following command should take care of this after unpacking the tarball and cd-ing 
into the package's directory:

  $ wget http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz -O - | gunzip -c > data/asteroids.dat
