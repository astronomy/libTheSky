libTheSky INSTALL



DEPENDENCIES:

You will need CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source
software, is included in many GNU/Linux distributions, and can be downloaded 
from http://www.cmake.org/.

libTheSky needs the Fortran library libSUFR in order to compile and run.  libSUFR is
free and open software, and available under the GPL v.3 from 
http://libsufr.sf.net/.



UNPACKING:

After downloading from libthesky.sf.net, you can unpack the tarball and cd into its 
directory by doing e.g.:

  $ tar xfz libthesky-0.1.1.tar.gz
  $ cd libthesky-0.1.1/

(replace you 0.1.1 with the correct version number).



COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

To compile and install the code and data files (in the default directories; /usr/...), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make install


To install the package in a specific directory, do e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. 
FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, replace the last step
 $ make install
with
 $ make


By default, library and module files will be installed as:
/usr/lib/libTheSky.*
/usr/include/libTheSky/*.mod


If you want to use the libraries with multiple Fortran compilers, you will want to 
keep the different versions of the library separated.  In this case, use (in addition 
to any other options):
 $ cmake -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on ..

The library files will then be installed as:
/usr/lib/libTheSky_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*
/usr/include/libTheSky/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod

If one of your Fortran compilers is your default, you can use both the default
installation method and the compiler-specific method to install the library.



DATA FILES:

The data files are in the data/ subdirectory of the package and will be installed in
/usr/shared/libTheSky/ by default.  All data files needed to run the code are provided 
in the package, except one:  asteroids.dat is not included, since it bloats the package 
by a factor of ~8 and it is readily available online.  To include it, download the file
http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz, unzip it, rename it to asteroids.dat, 
and copy it to the data/ subdirectory before running make install, or to e.g. 
/usr/shared/libTheSky/ after installing the package.

The following commands should take care of this after unpacking the tarball and cd-ing 
into the package's directory:

  $ wget http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz
  $ unzip ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz
  $ mv ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz data/asteroids.dat
