libTheSky INSTALL
libthesky.sf.net



DEPENDENCIES:

The default installer uses CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is
open-source software, is included in many GNU/Linux distributions, and can be 
downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.  Alternatively, you can create your own
Makefile or compile and link the code manually.

libTheSky needs the Fortran library libSUFR in order to compile and run.  libSUFR is
free and open software, and available under the GPL v.3 from http://libsufr.sf.net/.



UNPACKING:

After downloading from libthesky.sf.net, you can unpack the tarball and cd into its 
directory by doing e.g.:

  $ tar xfz libthesky-0.0.1.tar.gz
  $ cd libthesky-0.0.1/

(replace "0.0.1" with the correct version number).



CONFIGURING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

To configure, compile and install the code and data files (in the default system
directories /usr/local/...), from the main package directory (the one that contains 
the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

The second step above configures the code and should find your Fortran compiler and
libSUFR.  The third step compiles and links the code, and the last step installs it 
on your system - for which you need root priveliges, hence the 'sudo' command.


To install the package in a specific system directory, do e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/libTheSky/ ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the package in your own user directory, you won't need root priveliges,
can omit the 'sudo' command and combine the last two commands, e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/libTheSky/ ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. 
FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the install step
 
 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

The compiled libraries and modules can then be found in the usr/ subdirectory
of the package dir.


By default, library and module files will be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libTheSky.*
/usr/local/include/libTheSky/*.mod


If you want to use the libraries with multiple Fortran compilers, you will want to 
keep the different versions of the library separated.  In this case, use (in addition 
to any other options):
 $ cmake -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on ..

The library files will then be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libTheSky_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*
/usr/local/include/libTheSky/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod

If one of your Fortran compilers is your default, you can use both the default
installation method and the compiler-specific method to install the library.



DATA FILES:

The data files are distributed in a separate tarball, named libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2
They will unpack into the data/ subdirectory of the package and the code will expect to find
them in /usr/local/shared/libTheSky/ by default.  Hence, to install the data files manually,
do e.g.:
  $ tar xfj libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2
  $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/shared/libTheSky/
  $ sudo cp -vi data/* /usr/local/shared/libTheSky/

Alternatively, you can use the libTheSky_data target in the CMake file of the source code,
by copying the data files into that package's subdirectory before compiling it, and making
sure you install the data files as well:
  $ tar xfz libthesky-<0.0.1>.tar.gz
  $ tar xfj libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2
  $ mv data libthesky-0.0.1/
  $ cd libthesky-0.0.1/
  ...
  $ sudo make libTheSky_data install

All data files needed to use libTheSky are provided in the tarball.  The file asteroids.dat 
is a reduced version of the file http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz, containing 
all bodies with H<15 and a<100 AU (~25% of total, ~90,000 objects).  If you want to use the
full/latest version instead, do something like:
  $ wget http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz -O - | gunzip -c > data/asteroids.dat
